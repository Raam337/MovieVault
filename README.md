## Setup & Installation

### Prerequisites

### Installation Steps

1. Clone the repository
  ```
  git clone git@github.com:Raam337/MovieVault.git
  cd MovieVault
  ```

2. Install dependencies

*Make sure you start at /MovieVault*
```
npm install
cd proxy; npm install; cd..
```

3. Run the development server

`npm run development` - Run both proxy server and web app

Access web app at - [http://localhost:5173/](http://localhost:5173/)

Access proxy at - [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/)

(Connection can be tested by navigating to port 3000 and ensuring "Hello World!" is shown)

4. (Optional) Building for Production

*If you would like to generate production files again. This step can be skipped as project already contains prod files.*

```

npm run build

cd proxy

npm run build

cd ..

```

This will generate a dist/ folder containing builds in both folders.

5. Serve the built project:

`npm run production` - Launched from /movievault

Access production version - [http://localhost:4173/](http://localhost:4173/)

Proxy server can be tested at - [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/)

## Testing

In root directory use `npm run test` to access web page with testing data. **Must launch proxy server first!**
